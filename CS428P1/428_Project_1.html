                This is a Minecraft recreated in real life, an attraction to kids and all fans of minecraft related things. It is located in Seattle, washington.<br>
                In the picture I have above this section, there is a tree, rocks formation, steve and his tools either being held or laying on the grass. This repsents what it is like in game and in the museum.<br>
                Within the museum there are many things in this cube that was recreated in real life. The music I've included is also the theme song of minecraft usually being played in the background of your game.

                A coffin, usually the coffin is hidden somewhere inside those pyramids but for the sake of thematic, it's outside. There's also a statue of Maya and Meryt along with a human model to represents people.<br>
                A blazing sun that's radiating a heavy shine on the desert floor with Egyptian theme music.

                Personally I don’t think this kind of technology would be popular in the upcoming years. 
                I know that there’s potential for the tech to grow and expand. But it suffers the same problems as VR technology. 
                Even though the tech is great, the problem lies in the hands of the user/ consumer. Since we’re talking about popularity in this tech, 
                I assume it’s going to have to be adopted by a lot of people much like the iphone to reach that level. Wide adoption is what we’re looking for. 
                Even VR still has yet to get this. The games are fun and the immersiveness is to die for, but the effort of putting it on, 
                setting it up just isn’t worth it for most folks. For me personally, I’ve had the Meta Quest 2 for 2 years now but I’ve only played it on and off. 
                I rather just play games on my flat screen computer and be comfortable at the same time.
                <br><br>
                When you mention Augmented Reality, the general population is going to think of games, like pokemon go and other advertisements they see online for this kind of Tech. I think that’s one of the other big problems of Augmented Reality right now. There isn’t much use for it other than games and novel things. It is not useful in any way to the normal person just yet. If you think about it, in the movies and tv shows depicting AR, it’s usually something useful, such as your heart beat, texts, voice/ video calls, stats of things like nutrition labels, etc… This is ontop of being embedded into the person, or a very thin and light glass/ eye contact.So unless AR can mimic these sort of useful things, and becomes less cumbersome to put on as everyday wear, I don’t think it’s going to get widely adopted. 
                <br><br>
                I’m aware that outside of the consumer market, cooperate has taken Augmented Reality pretty well. The application for it when you use it in the context of military, fireflight, space, flight, and much much more training is amazing. I’ve seen videos of AR information on equipment/cargo around the workplace so employees can quickly scan with their eyes and get a good idea of the equipment’s status. This way you don’t have to check the equipment yourself. This requires a great deal of software development that works along with the hardware to give you accurate reports on the equipment at hand.
                <br><br>
                If we were to ignore all these problems and be optimistic about it. I could very see a great future for this technology to grow into what it’s promised. It could be our new iphones. You can check the time by just looking at the digital clock put on your wall by AR. You could check what you need for groceries with a quick glance at the fridge. Everything in life would be more enhanced and efficient. Everything will be embedded and connected to your AR device that you either wear.
