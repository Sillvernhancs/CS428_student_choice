                        The Varjo XR-3 is a mixed reality headset capable of life-like visual fidelity with human 
                        eye-like resolution at 70 PPD. It also packs in the widest field of view (at 115) in the XR industry. 
                        It is capable of almost perfectly mixing reality and virtual reality together.<br><br>
                        The intended users at the moment are for industrial and corporate only. Since the headset cost upwards of $7000 
                        and that doesn't include the yearly subscription. unless you have money to burn, the average person can't get their 
                        hands on technology like this yet.<br><br>

                <h3 style = "text-shadow: 0 3px 5px #0e0e0e">In this case, BOTH!</h3>

                        Since the headset does mix reality, it can do both VR and AR respectively. 
                        However it's slightly better at doing AR because it's using video pass-through 
                        with ultra-low latency (less than 20 ms) and a high-fidelity 12-megapixel video stream. 
                        It then layers virtual objects on top to augment the user's view. It's better than the likes of Hololense because of the 
                        quality and field of view of the virtual objects can't be matched.<br><br>
