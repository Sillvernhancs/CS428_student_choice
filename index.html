                        The Varjo XR-3 is a mixed reality headset capable of life-like visual fidelity with human 
                        eye-like resolution at 70 PPD. It also packs in the widest field of view (at 115) in the XR industry. 
                        It is capable of almost perfectly mixing reality and virtual reality together.<br><br>

                            Since the headset does mix reality, it can do both VR and AR respectively. However it's geared more towards AR because it's using video pass-through with ultra-low latency (less than 20 ms) and a high-fidelity 12-megapixel video stream. It has a total of 2 pairs of displays, one dedicated to the peripheral view and the other dedicated to focused view. This setup produces a life like fidelity. The headset fidelity was so real that users claimed it blurred the line between virtual reality and reality . It then layers virtual objects on top to augment the user's view. It's better than the likes of Hololense because the quality and field of view of the virtual objects can't be matched.

                            On the front of the headset it has Lidar and cameras, making the pass through video look amazing. Along with a combination of hand tracking and eye tracking technologies this headset delivers a very realistic XR experience.

                            The company that makes this headset, Varjo, is dead set on making the best display headset ever. Their users tend to be people in the field of: medical, automobile, engineers (hardware), designers, and government/military. They use this headset to do all kinds of things such as: showing a product to a client in real time (like a car), designing a product while seeing it to scale in real life, and high stress situation training. For the training part, the headset has been advertised to be used in flight training in the military, situation training like a firefighter in a dangerous environment, training the medical staff for CPR, and so much more.

                            Since the headset’s user group are in corporate, industrial, and military, the headset’s price is quite high. The headset costs around 7000$, and that’s only the headset. It can only use Valve's lighthouse technology to track itself (recommended to have 4 lighthouses for best experience in tracking). There is no controller, headphones included so you’ll also have to buy your own, as well. On top of everything you’ll have to pay a yearly subscription to keep it running. That will add up an eye watering $8000+ the yearly subscription. This makes sense for their user base still because they’ll save so much money on training, equipment, and personale the headset will pay itself out after some time.
